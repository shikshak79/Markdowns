**The Revenue Loop** is Product.Zone’s canonical framework for B2B growth that compounds.
Instead of treating revenue as a funnel, it models a continuous buyer + user journey across 10 stages: Land, Make Sense, Self-Select, Compare, Validate, Commit, Activate, Embed, Expand, Advocate. It also clarifies four “Fits” (Problem-Solution, Promise-Market, Product-Market, Growth-Market) and the decisions + surfaces that unlock each stage. Use it to diagnose where momentum breaks, identify the constraint, and prioritize the smallest intervention that restores buyer movement and post-sale pull.
