# Outside-In Diagnostic Framework

## Product.Zone — Zone Health Check

**Version:** 2.0 — February 2026  
**Purpose:** Holistic venture diagnostic using outside-in questions.  
**Design principle:** Ask how buyers, users, investors, and talent *experience* the venture — not how the founder runs it.  
**Cascade per zone:** Outside-in question → Decisions underneath → Surfaces where they render → Leading indicators (behavioral signals) → Lagging indicators (results)

---

## Why Outside-In

"How do you sell?" puts founders on the defensive.  
"How are your buyers coming to a yes?" surfaces the same information from the buyer's experience.

The answers reveal which decisions are locked, which are fuzzy, and which are missing — without the founder feeling audited.

Each zone has a name that describes the property the venture either has or lacks — assessed from the outside:

- A buyer assesses **Buyability**
- The market assesses **Viability**
- A committee member assesses **Travelability**
- A target prospect assesses **Reachability**
- A prospect at decision assesses **Closability**
- An existing customer assesses **Stickability** and **Expandability**
- An investor assesses **Fundability**
- A new market assesses **Portability**
- Talent assesses **Thriveability**

---

## On Desirability and Feasibility

The classic design triangle asks: desirable, feasible, viable?  
These are preconditions. This framework starts where the triangle ends — assuming genuine demand exists and something has been built.

**Desirability** is implied in Zone 1 (Buyability). If Zone 1 signals are consistently fuzzy or missing, dig deeper into whether demand is real before locking positioning decisions.

**Feasibility** is embedded in Zone 2 (Viability) as delivery capacity. In most software ventures today, technical build is no longer the constraint — delivery and scaling are.

---

## Health Scoring

For each zone, score the outside-in question:

**🟢 CLEAR** — Founder answers immediately, consistently, with evidence  
**🟡 FUZZY** — Founder answers with qualifications, hesitation, or "it depends"  
**🔴 MISSING** — Founder can't answer, or answers reveal the zone doesn't exist yet

---

## Zone Clusters

```
PRIMARY ZONES (Zones 1–5)
Every venture needs these, in sequence.
Run in every diagnostic session.

EXPANSION ZONES (Zones 6–10)
Triggered by specific conditions or stage.
Run when the primary path is working or a specific symptom appears.
```

---

# PRIMARY ZONES (1–5)

---

## Zone 1: Buyability

**Outside-in question:**

> **"Walk me through what a buyer experiences from first contact to 'I want this.' What makes them decide this is worth paying for?"**

*Listen for: clarity on who it's for, what it replaces, why it wins, what proof they need, what the safe first step is.*

### Decisions underneath:

**Positioning class (Buying Engine)**

| Decision    | What it locks                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Category    | What bucket the buyer places you in — job + alternative + name |
| Customer    | Who it's clearly for / not for — ICP boundary + disqualifiers |
| Alternative | What buyers use today + why it fails for the job             |
| Difference  | The mechanism that solves the shortcoming alternatives can't fix |
| Outcome     | What the buyer can NOW do that they couldn't before          |

**Trust class (Buying Engine)**

| Decision       | What it locks                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proof type     | What evidence actually convinces this specific buyer       |
| Proof moments  | What they must see in 90 seconds to believe                |
| Decision risks | Migration, ownership, ROI path, compliance, switching cost |

**Movement class (Buying Engine)**

| Decision         | What it locks                                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| First step offer | The low-risk "yes" — decision de-risking, not "try product" |

### Surfaces where decisions render:

| Surface                | Role                                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Homepage               | Answers all positioning decisions — primary self-select surface |
| LinkedIn / Content     | Warms up right buyers before contact, primes category        |
| First email / Outbound | Trigger + wedge — sparks the right question                  |
| First sales call       | Founder tells same story every time — decisions prevent improvisation |

### Leading indicators (behavioral signals):

- Qualified meetings self-select in ("this sounds exactly like us")
- Wrong-fit buyers self-select out before call
- "I shared this with my team" happens in first week
- Buyers start call by referencing what they saw on homepage or LinkedIn
- Buyers name the correct alternative in opening conversation

### Lagging indicators (results):

- % of meetings that were pre-qualified
- Conversion: first contact → meeting booked
- Time from first contact → "I want to proceed"

### 🚩 Fuzzy signals to listen for:

- "We're for companies that want to X" (too broad, no buyer context)
- "It depends on the customer" (alternative not named)
- "We explain it on the call" (surfaces not doing the work)
- "Deals come from different directions" (no repeatable entry)

---

## Zone 2: Viability

**Outside-in question:**

> **"If 50 buyers said yes in the next 12 months — what would have to be true about your pricing, your capacity, and the size of the market you're selling to?"**

*Listen for: whether the math has ever been done, what the ceiling is, whether they've hit constraints yet.*

### Decisions underneath:

**Value + Pricing class (Monetizing Engine)**

| Decision       | What it locks                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value metric   | What pricing is based on (per-user / per-deployment / flat / usage) |
| Price anchor   | The reference point — ballpark / tier / "is this worth paying for?" |
| Target ACV     | What deals should look like at scale                         |
| WTP proof      | What you've actually seen buyers pay                         |
| Price fences   | Who gets which price — prevents discounting chaos            |
| Discount rules | So nobody improvises under pressure                          |

**Packaging + Offer class (Monetizing Engine)**

| Decision     | What it locks                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Core package | The "buy this" unit — what's in, what's out |
| Tier logic   | Why tiers exist — clear upgrade triggers    |
| Pilot offer  | Paid/structured entry vs. endless free demo |

**Supporting (Buying + Investing Engines)**

| Decision                  | What it locks                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Customer (size)           | Segment ceiling — how many ICP buyers exist and are reachable |
| Unit economics hypothesis | LTV:CAC rough model even if early                            |
| Sensitivity               | What breaks the revenue case                                 |

### Surfaces where decisions render:

| Surface                  | Role                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Pricing page / proposal  | Reflects real WTP + tier boundaries clearly         |
| Business model one-pager | Segment math + unit economics defensible in writing |
| Board / investor update  | Revenue ceiling + expansion plan held externally    |

### Leading indicators (behavioral signals):

- Buyers don't flinch at price — no "that's expensive" as first response
- Deals close at list price — not constantly negotiated down
- Founder quotes segment ceiling and expansion plan without hesitation
- CFO approves without requesting renegotiation

### Lagging indicators (results):

- ACV hitting or missing target
- LTV:CAC ratio
- Revenue ceiling approaching (or not yet visible)
- Gross margin at viable threshold for business model

### Scale Gate verdict:

- ✅ **GO** — Segment supports €500K+ ARR, unit economics hold, delivery scales
- ⚠️ **CONSTRAINED** — Works short-term, ceiling visible, expansion path needed now
- ❌ **NO-GO** — Math doesn't work at this price/segment/capacity combination

### 🚩 Fuzzy signals to listen for:

- "We're still figuring out pricing"
- "Every deal is priced differently"
- "The market is huge" (no segment math done)
- "We haven't hit capacity yet" (unaware of constraint)

---

## Zone 3: Travelability

**Outside-in question:**

> **"What does a buyer see, read, or receive when you're not in the room? Can they forward something to their team that explains why this is worth approving?"**

*Listen for: whether a consistent artifact exists, whether the team can pitch it, whether committee members can repeat it.*

### Decisions underneath:

**Trust class (Buying Engine)**

| Decision             | What it locks                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Value formula        | Repeatable ROI logic a champion can defend without you present |
| Implementation truth | Effort, prerequisites, "who does what" — no surprises        |
| Risk reversal        | Pilot/rollback, guarantees, bounded scope — makes it safe enough |

**Movement class (Buying Engine)**

| Decision     | What it locks                                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Offer scope  | Itemized deliverables + explicit boundaries — travels without voiceover |
| Start recipe | Who attends, what to bring, what you get — eliminates "what next?" |
| Price anchor | Commitment framing — what does "yes" actually cost           |

**Supporting (Monetizing Engine)**

| Decision     | What it locks                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Champion kit | What the internal advocate needs to sell it up |
| Decision map | Who signs, who blocks, who influences          |
| Close plan   | How deals end — explicit next step per deal    |

### Surfaces where decisions render:

| Surface                    | Role                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sales deck / one-pager     | Works without voiceover — committee member can read alone    |
| Proof pack                 | Case studies, numbers, quotes — travels in email             |
| Sales brief                | Objection handling for the champion — pre-answers committee questions |
| Homepage                   | Committee member lands here after being forwarded a link     |
| Proposal / scope doc       | Package + value formula rendered — defensible in procurement |
| Security / compliance pack | Risk reduction for technical + legal stakeholders            |

### Leading indicators (behavioral signals):

- "I showed my CTO / CFO / board" happens in first week
- Team members closing deals without founder present
- Prospects referencing homepage or deck details in follow-up emails
- Deal advances without founder on every call
- Champion forwards materials unprompted

### Lagging indicators (results):

- Team close rate vs. founder close rate (gap shrinking?)
- Deals progressing beyond first call without founder involvement
- "How did you find us?" answers pointing to surfaces working

### 🚩 Fuzzy signals to listen for:

- "We rewrite the deck for each client"
- "It's hard to explain without me on the call"
- "Our team struggles to close like I do"
- "The homepage is placeholder right now"

---

## Zone 4: Reachability

**Outside-in question:**

> **"How do the right buyers find you — or how do you find them? What does a qualified conversation look like before it starts?"**

*Listen for: whether there's a repeatable channel, what makes an outreach response happen, how many conversations per month and whether they're qualified.*

### Decisions underneath:

**Channels class (Monetizing Engine)**

| Decision                 | What it locks                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Primary channel          | Which single channel is bet on — with evidence |
| Channel validation       | Proof this channel works for this ICP          |
| Targeting criteria       | What makes someone worth reaching              |
| Outreach trigger         | What specific signal prompts outreach          |
| Conversation entry       | What creates a reply — hook, not pitch         |
| Partner / referral logic | What makes a partner worth activating          |
| Channel economics        | CAC per channel — which is sustainable         |

### Surfaces where decisions render:

| Surface                       | Role                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| LinkedIn profile + content    | Right buyers arriving before contact |
| Outbound email / DM sequences | What gets a reply                    |
| Partner / VC channel          | Warm introductions flowing           |
| Target list                   | Built systematically or ad hoc       |
| Channel assets / partner kit  | Enables others to refer accurately   |
| X-RAY diagnostic              | Pattern interrupt for cold outreach  |

### Leading indicators (behavioral signals):

- Right-fit buyers requesting meetings (not just anyone)
- Reply rates to outreach above 5%
- Inbound DMs increasing week-over-week
- VC / partner introductions arriving
- Outreach references specific alternative prospect uses

### Lagging indicators (results):

- Qualified conversations per month
- CAC per channel
- Channel source of closed deals (which is actually working?)

### 🚩 Fuzzy signals to listen for:

- "We get leads from everywhere" (no channel bet)
- "We reach out when we have time" (no systematic rhythm)
- "Most calls are still from warm intros" (channel not yet built)
- "We're testing a few things" (validation hasn't happened)
- "We avoid cold calling" (symptom — dig into why)

---

## Zone 5: Closability

**Outside-in question:**

> **"What does a buyer need to see, hear, or feel to sign? What's the last thing that happens before they commit?"**

*Listen for: whether there's a consistent close moment, what objections stall deals, whether the founder knows the committee members who need to say yes.*

### Decisions underneath:

**Sales motion class (Monetizing Engine)**

| Decision          | What it locks                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decision map      | Who signs, who blocks, who influences — champion knows the path |
| Objection library | Top 5 doubts + their proof responses                         |
| Risk reversal     | What makes it safe to commit (pilot, rollback, bounded scope) |
| Start recipe      | What happens after yes — clear enough to feel safe           |
| Qualification     | Clear yes/no on fit — when to walk away                      |
| Deal stages       | Predictable stages with clear exit criteria                  |

**Commercial terms class (Monetizing Engine)**

| Decision       | What it locks                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Contract       | Standard vs. custom — when to redline          |
| Payment terms  | Invoice cadence, PO path, payment on signature |
| SLAs           | What you're committing to — no surprises       |
| Legal redlines | What you'll accept and won't                   |

### Surfaces where decisions render:

| Surface               | Role                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sales call (closing)  | Objection handling live — decisions locked prevent improvisation |
| Proof pack            | Final evidence for committee — travels to procurement        |
| Proposal / scope doc  | Package + value formula — survives procurement               |
| Pilot offer           | Low-risk entry that survives committee review                |
| Contract / legal pack | Reduces friction at signature                                |
| Sales brief           | Champion arm — pre-answers what procurement will ask         |

### Leading indicators (behavioral signals):

- "What would it take to move forward?" gets a specific answer
- Champion introduces founder to additional stakeholders
- Legal / procurement contact made (deal is real)
- Objections shift from "what is this?" to "how does it work?"
- Pilot or next step accepted without negotiation

### Lagging indicators (results):

- Win rate (closed won / total qualified pipeline)
- Sales cycle length (days from first meeting to signed)
- Average deal size vs. target ACV
- Discount rate (how often list price holds)

### 🚩 Fuzzy signals to listen for:

- "Every deal is different" (no consistent close pattern)
- "We're waiting to hear back" (no explicit next step)
- "The champion loves it but procurement is slowing it down"
- "We discounted to close" (price anchor not holding)
- "Only the founder can close" (Zone 3 / Travelability problem bleeding in)

---

# EXPANSION ZONES (6–10)

*Activate when triggered by stage or specific symptom — not all are live simultaneously.*

---

## Zone 6: Stickability

**Activate when:** 10+ customers exist AND retention/activation signals are weak.

**Outside-in question:**

> **"What brings a customer back after first use? What's the moment they stop treating it as a trial and start depending on it?"**

### Decisions underneath:

- Activation moment — the one event that means "they got it"
- First value path — shortest route to that moment
- Habit loop — what pulls them back weekly/monthly?
- Renewal proof — what do you show at renewal to justify continue?
- Churn triggers — early warning signals + intervention plan

### Surfaces:

Onboarding flow, in-product prompts, CS touchpoints, usage reporting, renewal conversation, templates / playbooks

### Leading indicators:

- Second-use rate
- Critical workflow adoption
- CS intervention rate declining
- "Can we expand to another team?" (signals value locked in)

### Lagging indicators:

- Gross revenue retention (GRR)
- Churn rate (monthly / annual)
- Time-to-activation

---

## Zone 7: Expandability

**Activate when:** Tool pricing tension visible, or expansion revenue is flat.

**Outside-in question:**

> **"What makes a customer pay more, or expand from one team/site/use case to several? What's the trigger?"**

### Decisions underneath:

- Value metric — what is pricing based on?
- Pricing fences — what triggers a tier upgrade?
- Expansion trigger — what event makes expansion obvious to the buyer?
- Champion economics kit — can the buyer calculate ROI independently?
- Expansion axis — users / teams / sites / use cases?
- CS playbook — how does the CS motion drive expansion?

### Surfaces:

Pricing page, expansion offer, renewal conversation, ROI calculator, usage dashboard

### Leading indicators:

- Customer initiates upsell conversation
- Usage hitting tier limits
- Champion mentions ROI unprompted
- "What does the next tier include?"

### Lagging indicators:

- Net revenue retention (NRR)
- Average ACV over time
- Expansion revenue as % of total

---

## Zone 8: Fundability

**Activate when:** Fundraising is on the 12-month horizon.

**Outside-in question:**

> **"What does an investor see in this venture that makes them confident the next €XM will generate more than €XM back? What's the evidence?"**

### Decisions underneath:

- Investment thesis — strategic fit, why now, why this team
- Business case — value story, cost story, ROI path
- Unit economics — LTV:CAC, payback period, gross margin
- Evidence plan — what must be true, what stage gates exist
- Governance — who decides, how capital is released, kill switch

### Surfaces:

Pitch deck (investor), data room, board materials, milestones doc, evidence dashboard, business model one-pager

### Leading indicators:

- "We'd like a second meeting" from investors
- LP / partner introductions arriving
- Due diligence questions arriving

### Lagging indicators:

- Round closed
- Valuation
- Time from first pitch to term sheet

---

## Zone 9: Portability

**Activate when:** Beachhead is working and conscious expansion is on the roadmap.

**Outside-in question:**

> **"When a buyer from a new segment or geography encounters this — what makes them say 'this is for us too'? What changes and what stays the same?"**

### Decisions underneath:

- New ICP boundary — who is Archetype B, precisely?
- Category framing for B — same category or adjusted?
- New proof requirements — what does Archetype B need to see?
- Channel for B — same channel or new one?
- Beachhead + path — what's the wedge into new market?

### Surfaces:

Adapted homepage section, new case studies, targeted outbound for Archetype B, channel assets / partner kit

### Leading indicators:

- Archetype B responding positively to outreach
- Different ICP converting at similar rates to Archetype A

### Lagging indicators:

- Revenue from new segment
- Close rate vs. Archetype A baseline

---

## Zone 10: Thriveability

**Activate when:** First hire is imminent, or founder dependency is creating a ceiling.

**Outside-in question:**

> **"What makes people want to join, stay, and do their best work here — and how would you know if that was breaking down?"**

*Listen for: whether roles are clear, whether accountability is real, whether the org is designed for the stage, whether people can act without the founder, whether signals of disengagement exist.*

*Note: Unlike other expansion zones, Thriveability becomes relevant earlier than it appears — the moment a second person joins. The stakes increase sharply at Zone 4-5 when team must close and execute without founder.*

### Decisions underneath:

**Organization design**

| Decision                  | What it locks                                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Roles                     | What each person is actually accountable for (not title — real scope) |
| Accountabilities          | Who owns which decisions — pricing, roadmap, hiring, discounting |
| Org design                | Team shape right for current zone (not the org you want, the one you need now) |
| Hire sequence             | Who is next hire, and what zone trigger determines timing    |
| Build vs. buy vs. partner | Which capabilities to own vs. access                         |

**Operating system**

| Decision          | What it locks                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Incentives        | How people are rewarded — reinforces right behavior          |
| Delegation system | What founder has explicitly handed off vs. still holding     |
| Operating cadence | How work actually gets done — rituals, rhythm, decision velocity |
| Decision rights   | Who can decide what without escalating to founder            |
| Governance        | How conflicts resolve — who decides when functions disagree  |

**Investing Engine — supporting**

| Decision      | What it locks                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Evidence plan | What must be true — stage gates per zone         |
| Capabilities  | Team shape, hiring plan, CS capability readiness |

### Surfaces where decisions render:

| Surface                              | Role                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Employer brand (LinkedIn, job posts) | Attracts right people before application                 |
| Job descriptions                     | Specific enough to self-select right candidate           |
| Handbook / playbook                  | Documented — or still in founder's head?                 |
| Org chart                            | Reflects current stage, not aspirational future          |
| Onboarding plan                      | New hire productive within 60 days                       |
| Incentive / comp structure           | Written, understood by team                              |
| Operating rituals doc                | How meetings run, how decisions get made                 |
| Sales playbook                       | Team executes without founder on every call              |
| Zone ownership map                   | Who owns each zone's decisions — prevents drift          |
| Evidence dashboard                   | Leading indicators tracked by someone other than founder |
| Milestones doc                       | Stage gates written down — everyone aligned              |
| Decision ledger                      | Locked decisions documented — prevents re-litigating     |

### Leading indicators (behavioral signals):

- Team members making decisions without founder loop (velocity up)
- New hires contributing meaningfully within 60 days
- Team members referring candidates (they want friends here)
- Founder time in day-to-day operations declining week-over-week
- Internal communication shows initiative, not just status updates
- People raising problems before founder notices them
- Team closes deals, ships features, resolves issues without escalation
- Team using same language as founder (positioning has transferred)
- Reps closing at 80%+ of founder's win rate
- Positioning consistent across channels without founder review

### Lagging indicators (results):

- Founder dependency score (% of revenue / decisions still touched by founder)
- Hire success rate (still working at 6 months? 12 months?)
- Team close rate vs. founder close rate (gap narrowing?)
- Time-to-productivity for new hires
- Retention rate (are people staying?)
- Revenue per employee (efficiency improving with headcount?)

### Zone relevance:

```
Zone 1–3:  Founder dependency expected but playbook should be forming
Zone 4–5:  Team must execute pipeline without founder
           First senior hire decision imminent
           → Highest risk zone for People failure
Zone 6–7:  Founder out of delivery entirely
           Operating system must run independently
Zone 8+:   Org design becomes investor signal
           "Can this team execute the plan?"
```

### 🚩 Fuzzy signals to listen for:

- "We're small, everyone does everything" (no role clarity)
- "I haven't had time to document the playbook" (founder still the system)
- "We hired a VP Sales but it didn't work out" (org infrastructure was missing)
- "Recruitment is hard in our space" (employer brand not doing the work)
- "We're figuring out the culture as we go" (no operating system)
- "My team is great but customers always want to talk to me" (delegation not real)
- "We're about to make our first senior hire" (hire sequence not locked)

### Probe questions if fuzzy:

- "Who on your team could run your next sales call without you?"
- "If you had to hire your next person tomorrow, what role and why?"
- "What's the last decision you made that someone else could have made?"
- "How do you know if someone on the team is struggling or disengaged?"
- "What would break first if you took 3 months off?"

# DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW GUIDE

## Session structure (60–90 min)

**Opening (5 min):**

> *"Before we recommend anything, we want to understand how your venture is working from the outside in — from your buyers', users', and team's experience. We'll work zone by zone. Some questions will feel obvious; others might surface where the friction is. That's the point."*

---

**Zone 1 — Buyability (10 min):**

> "Walk me through what a buyer experiences from first contact to 'I want this.' What makes them decide it's worth paying for?"

Probe if fuzzy:

- "Who specifically — what role, what kind of company?"
- "What are they using today instead of this?"
- "Why do they approve you over that alternative?"
- "What's the first safe step you offer them?"

---

**Zone 2 — Viability (10 min):**

> "If 50 buyers said yes in the next 12 months — what would have to be true about pricing, capacity, and segment size?"

Probe if fuzzy:

- "How many companies fit the profile you just described?"
- "What's a typical deal size?"
- "What does it cost you to deliver one deal?"
- "When does that model break?"

---

**Zone 3 — Travelability (10 min):**

> "What does a buyer see when you're not in the room? Can they forward something to their team and have it land?"

Probe if fuzzy:

- "What does your homepage say right now?"
- "Can your team close without you?"
- "What happens when the champion tries to sell it internally?"

---

**Zone 4 — Reachability (10 min):**

> "How do the right buyers find you — or how do you find them?"

Probe if fuzzy:

- "Where did your last 5 customers come from?"
- "What's the one channel you're betting on this quarter?"
- "What does a conversation look like before it starts?"

---

**Zone 5 — Closability (10 min):**

> "What does a buyer need to sign? What's the last obstacle before they commit?"

Probe if fuzzy:

- "Who else needs to say yes besides your champion?"
- "What objection comes up in almost every deal?"
- "What's your pilot or low-risk first step?"

---

**Conditional expansion zones (5 min each, only if triggered):**

*If 10+ customers exist:*

> "What brings a customer back after first use?" *(Zone 6 — Stickability)*

*If pricing tension or flat expansion revenue:*

> "What makes a customer pay more or expand?" *(Zone 7 — Expandability)*

*If fundraising on 12-month horizon:*

> "What does an investor see that makes them confident?" *(Zone 8 — Fundability)*

*If founder dependency is visible or first hire imminent:*

> "What makes people want to join, stay, and do their best work here?" *(Zone 10 — Thriveability)*

---

**Synthesis (10 min):**

Summarize what's locked, fuzzy, and missing per zone.  
Recommend intervention starting point.

**Scorecard:**

# ZONE ACTIVATION MAP

```
ALWAYS ACTIVE (Primary path — every venture):
Zone 1 — Buyability       Lock first. Everything else depends on this.
Zone 2 — Viability        Lock simultaneously with Zone 1.

BUILD IN SEQUENCE:
Zone 3 — Travelability    Before first non-founder sales attempt.
Zone 4 — Reachability     After Zones 1–3 locked. Don't scale confusion.
Zone 5 — Closability      When pipeline exists but deals are stalling.

ON DEMAND (Expansion zones — when triggered):
Zone 6 — Stickability     10+ customers OR weak retention signals.
Zone 7 — Expandability    Tool pricing trap OR flat expansion revenue.
Zone 8 — Fundability      6–12 months before fundraising horizon.
Zone 9 — Portability      Beachhead proven, expansion on roadmap.
Zone 10 — Thriveability   First hire imminent OR founder dependency ceiling.
```

# THE CASCADE RULE

Decisions locked in earlier zones power later zones:

```
Zone 1 (Category, Customer, Alternative, Difference, Outcome)
  → Powers Zone 3 (materials that travel)
  → Powers Zone 4 (targeting and outreach)
  → Powers Zone 8 (investor thesis "why we win")
  → Powers Zone 9 (what to re-lock for new market)

Zone 2 (Price anchor, Package, Unit economics)
  → Powers Zone 5 (close the deal)
  → Powers Zone 7 (expansion pricing)
  → Powers Zone 8 (revenue model for investor)

Zone 3 (Value formula, Start recipe, Risk reversal)
  → Powers Zone 5 (committee buy-in, procurement)
  → Powers Zone 7 (champion economics kit)

Zone 6 (Activation, Habit loop, Renewal proof)
  → Powers Zone 7 (expansion triggers, health scores)

Zone 10 (Decision rights, Playbook, Operating system)
  → Maintains and protects all other zones from drifting
  → Enables every zone to run without founder
