## The Constraint Moved

For decades, the hard question was: "Can we build it?"

Technical feasibility was the risk. Hardware was expensive. Software took years. Distribution required shelf space or salesforces or broadcast access. If you could build it and ship it, customers would come. The bottleneck was upstream.

That world is gone.

Cloud infrastructure, open source, no-code tools, and AI collapsed build time from years to weeks. A capable team can ship a working product in a month. Technical feasibility is largely solved.

The bottleneck moved downstream.

Now the hard question is: "Can we sell it AND deliver?"

You can build almost anything. That doesn't mean anyone will buy it. And if they buy it, that doesn't mean they'll stay. The risk shifted from feasibility to buyability. From "can we make it work?" to "can we make them want it, pay for it, use it, and come back?"

Most companies still operate as if building is the constraint. They staff engineering heavy. They ship features. They assume sales and retention will follow.

The companies that win now are the ones that solved buyability. They have a system for getting to yes AND proving it right. The Revenue Loop is that system.

## The Problem With How We Talk About Growth

Everyone uses the word "funnel." The mental model is broken.

Funnels leak. You pour leads in the top, some percentage drips out the bottom as revenue, and you measure the loss at each stage. The customer who bought disappears from the model. Their results don't feed back. Their expansion is a separate funnel. Their advocacy is marketing's problem.

B2B revenue works differently. The customer who bought becomes proof for the next buyer. The user who embedded the product tells a colleague. The team that expanded triggers a new buying cycle with a bigger scope.

Revenue doesn't drip down. It compounds around.

## The Models That Got Us Here

Most sales and revenue frameworks share the same flaw: they're built from the seller's perspective.

### SPICED, BANT, MEDDIC

These are qualification frameworks. They ask: "Can I sell this deal?" The questions probe the buyer for information the seller needs: budget, authority, timeline, decision process, pain.

The buyer's psychological journey is invisible. Where are they mentally? What question is in their head right now? What would make them stop or move? The frameworks don't ask.

### The Bowtie Model

Bowtie improved on the funnel by adding post-purchase stages. Acquisition on the left, expansion on the right, revenue in the middle.

The flaw: it's still two separate funnels stitched at the seam. The "customer" on the right side is treated as a different entity than the "prospect" on the left. But it's the same person. The champion who bought is the champion who needs to see results. The CFO who approved is the CFO who checks the numbers at renewal.

Bowtie sees two processes. Reality is one continuous journey.

### Pipeline Stages

MQL, SQL, Opportunity, Negotiation, Closed Won. These are CRM stages. They track where the deal is in YOUR process.

They don't track where the buyer is in THEIR journey. A deal can sit at "Opportunity" for months while the buyer cycles between Compare and Validate, bringing in new stakeholders, re-evaluating alternatives, waiting for internal budget cycles.

Pipeline stages measure your activity. They don't diagnose buyer movement.

---

## The Shift

The Revenue Loop starts from a different question.

Inside-out models ask: "Where is this deal in our process?"

The Revenue Loop asks: "Where is this buyer in their journey?"

Same deal. Different lens. The first lens optimizes your pipeline. The second lens removes obstacles from their path.

     │                          ▼
   EMBED ◄─── ACTIVATE ◄─── COMMIT
```

**Two arcs. One continuous journey.**

The left arc is **Getting to Yes**: the buyer's psychological journey from first contact to signed deal.

The right arc is **Proving it Right**: the user's experience from first use to embedded dependency to expansion.

The arcs connect. Commit bridges into Activate. Advocate feeds back to Land. What looks like two journeys is actually one loop.

## The Ten Stages

### Getting to Yes

| Stage | The question in their head | What breaks it |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Land** | "Is this for someone like me?" | Wrong people show up. Right people bounce. |
| **Make Sense** | "What is this, really? Why does it win?" | Can't explain to boss. "Interesting" but no action. |
| **Self-Select** | "Is this really for us?" | Everyone says "maybe." No one is certain. |
| **Compare** | "How does this stack against what we have?" | No urgency. Alternative not named. |
| **Validate** | "Can I trust this? Will I look stupid?" | Proof doesn't land. Champions won't forward. |
| **Commit** | "Is it safe to move? What happens after yes?" | "Let's talk next quarter." No clear path. |

### Proving it Right

| Stage | The question in their head | What breaks it |
|-------|---------------------------|----------------|
| **Activate** | "Does it actually work?" | First use fails. Value not obvious. |
| **Embed** | "Can I live without this?" | Nice to have, not need to have. Easy to cancel. |
| **Expand** | "Should we do more?" | No trigger. No path. Usage plateaus. |
| **Advocate** | "Should I tell others?" | Nothing remarkable. No story to tell. |

## The Four Fits

The industry talks about Product-Market Fit like it's one thing. It's not. There are four distinct stages, and most founders confuse them.

### Problem-Solution Fit

**What it means:** The product actually solves the problem.

**Where in the loop:** Activate → Embed (green arc only)

**How to validate:** Free users. No commercial test required. Give someone the product, see if they use it twice, see if they stick.

**The question it answers:** "Does this work?"

**Broken when:** Users churn. Activation fails. "Interesting" but not essential.

---

### Promise-Market Fit

**What it means:** The pitch lands. Buyers say yes.

**Where in the loop:** Land → Commit (Getting to Yes arc only)

**How to validate:** Deals close. The sales motion works. Buyers understand the promise and approve the purchase.

**The question it answers:** "Can we sell it?"

**Broken when:** Lots of conversations, few closes. Interest without approval. "Come back next quarter."

**The trap:** Most founders stop here. Deals closing feels like Product-Market Fit. It's not. You've validated that the promise resonates. You haven't validated that the product delivers on it.

---

### Product-Market Fit

**What it means:** The promise can be sold AND the product delivers on it.

**Where in the loop:** Land → Commit → Activate → Embed (3/4 revolution)

**How to validate:** Paid customers who stick. Full value exchange: money went one way, value went the other, both parties would do it again.

**The question it answers:** "Can we sell it AND deliver?"

**Broken when:** Deals close but customers churn. Or customers love it but won't pay. Both halves must work.

**The full test:** Promise-Market Fit plus Problem-Solution Fit, with paying customers. The commercial and the product working together.

---

### Growth-Market Fit

**What it means:** The loop is self-reinforcing. Success creates more success.

**Where in the loop:** Full revolution plus all feedback loops active.

**How to validate:** 
- Advocacy creates inbound (Advocate → Land)
- Customer results become sales proof (Embed → Validate)
- Expansion triggers new buying cycles (Expand → Compare)

**The question it answers:** "Does the system feed itself?"

**Broken when:** Growth requires constant pushing. Every deal starts from scratch. No compounding.

---

## The Sequence

```
PROBLEM-SOLUTION FIT     "Does the product work?"
        ↓                 (validate with free users)
        
PROMISE-MARKET FIT       "Can we sell the promise?"
        ↓                 (validate with closed deals)
        
PRODUCT-MARKET FIT       "Does the product deliver on the promise?"
        ↓                 (validate with paid customers who stick)
        
GROWTH-MARKET FIT        "Does success create more success?"
                          (validate with compounding revenue)
```

Each fit builds on the previous. Skip one and the next one breaks.

---

## The Common Mistake

> "We have PMF! Deals are closing!"

Probably not. You likely have Promise-Market Fit.

Closing deals proves you can sell the promise. It doesn't prove the product delivers. That test happens after Commit, when real users hit Activate and Embed.

Real Product-Market Fit requires:
- Promise sold (Getting to Yes works)
- Promise kept (Activate and Embed work)
- Full value exchange (money AND value moved)

Most founders celebrate at Commit and are surprised by churn at Embed. They validated the promise. They never validated the product.

---

## The Four Feedback Loops

When Growth-Market Fit is achieved, four loops start spinning:

### 1. Proof Loop
Embed results become Validate proof for the next buyer.

"Here's what happened when Company X used this." That story didn't exist until the loop completed. Now it's sales ammunition.

### 2. Expansion Loop  
Expand triggers a mini buying cycle.

New scope, new budget, new approval required. The customer re-enters at Compare: "How does this expanded version stack against alternatives?" Expansion isn't automatic. It's a new sale.

### 3. Renewal Loop
Embed success validates the original Commit decision.

The CFO who approved the deal checks the results. "Was I right?" If Embed worked, Commit is validated. If not, renewal is at risk.

### 4. Reputation Loop
Advocate warms new buyers before they Land.

Word of mouth. Referrals. "You should talk to these people." New buyers arrive pre-warmed because someone who completed the loop told them to.

---

## Stakeholder Continuity

The same people span both arcs. This is why it's one loop, not two processes.

### The Champion

| Stage | Their experience |
|-------|------------------|
| Validate | Sells it internally. Stakes reputation. |
| Activate | Actually uses it. First real test. |
| Embed | Gets credit if it works. Blame if it doesn't. |
| Expand | Asks for more budget. Restarts buying cycle. |

### The Economic Buyer (CFO)

| Stage | Their experience |
|-------|------------------|
| Commit | Approves based on projected ROI. |
| Embed | Checks actual ROI. "Was I right?" |
| Expand | Approves more spend, or kills the renewal. |

The champion who sold it internally is the same champion who needs it to work. The CFO who approved the budget is the same CFO who checks the results.

The loop isn't a handoff between teams. It's a continuous journey for the same people.

---

## The Architecture Underneath

The loop is what buyers and users experience. Underneath it sits the architecture that makes each stage work.

### Decisions

Every stage has specific decisions that unlock it.

| Stage | Decisions that must be locked |
|-------|------------------------------|
| Land | Category, Customer |
| Make Sense | Alternative, Difference, Outcome |
| Self-Select | ICP boundary, Disqualifiers |
| Compare | Alternative (named), Mechanism |
| Validate | Proof type, Decision risks, Value formula |
| Commit | First step offer, Risk reversal, Start recipe |
| Activate | Activation moment, First value path |
| Embed | Habit loop, Renewal proof |
| Expand | Value metric, Expansion trigger |
| Advocate | Story worth telling, Reference program |

When decisions are fuzzy, teams improvise at every stage.  
When decisions are locked, buyers and users walk themselves through.

### Surfaces

Decisions render on surfaces. Surfaces are what buyers and users actually see.

| Stage | Surfaces that serve it |
|-------|----------------------|
| Land | Homepage header, LinkedIn, Cold outreach |
| Make Sense | Homepage body, First call, Explainer deck |
| Self-Select | "Who it's for" section, Qualification flow |
| Compare | "Unlike..." section, Competitive frame |
| Validate | Case studies, Proof pack, Demo, ROI calculator |
| Commit | Pilot offer, Proposal, Contract |
| Activate | Onboarding flow, First-run experience |
| Embed | Usage triggers, Success check-ins |
| Expand | Expansion offer, Usage dashboard |
| Advocate | Referral program, Case study invitation |

When surfaces contradict each other, buyers get confused.  
When surfaces align with locked decisions, the message compounds.

---

## Growth Motions

Growth motions sit on top of the loop. They determine which path through the loop is dominant.

### Product-Led Growth (PLG)

The product is the channel. Users experience Activate before Commit. Advocacy happens through usage and sharing.

**Loop emphasis:** Activate → Embed → Advocate → Land

**Buying often happens after using.** Free tier proves value, paid tier unlocks more.

### Sales-Led Growth (SLG)

Relationships and outbound drive entry. Sales guides Getting to Yes.

**Loop emphasis:** Land → Commit (heavy sales involvement)

**Commit happens before Activate.** The deal closes, then usage begins.

### Marketing-Led Growth (MLG)

Content and inbound warm buyers before contact. Marketing does the work of Land and Make Sense.

**Loop emphasis:** Advocate → Land (content becomes proof)

**Buyers arrive pre-educated.** First call isn't discovery. It's validation.

### Partner-Led Growth

Ecosystem relationships feed new buyers. Partners provide credibility and access.

**Loop emphasis:** External trust → Land

**Someone else's reputation accelerates your Land and Validate.**

---

Most companies aren't purely one motion. They layer them. But knowing which motion is primary tells you where to invest and what to measure.

---

## Business Model Layer

Revenue isn't one stage. It's an economic layer that runs underneath the whole loop.

| Stage | Business model decision |
|-------|------------------------|
| Compare, Validate | **Pricing**: what's the anchor? What do buyers expect to pay? |
| Commit | **Deal structure**: payment terms, contract length, ramp |
| Activate, Embed | **Value metric**: what proves ROI? How do customers measure success? |
| Expand | **Expansion trigger**: what unlocks more spend? Usage? Seats? Outcomes? |

The business model either enables or constrains the loop.

**Enables:** Pricing matches value delivered. Expansion has a natural trigger. Unit economics hold at scale.

**Constrains:** Pricing creates friction at Commit. No expansion path designed. Delivery costs eat margin.

Business model work can't be separated from loop work. The economics and the experience are intertwined.

---

## Diagnostic Use

The Revenue Loop is a diagnostic tool. Every stuck venture is stuck at a specific stage.

### Finding the Constraint

**Step 1:** Which arc is broken?

- Getting to Yes broken → Deals don't close. Interest but no approval.
- Proving it Right broken → Deals close but customers churn. Acquisition works, retention doesn't.

**Step 2:** Which stage is broken?

Walk the loop. Find where buyers or users stop moving. That's the constraint.

**Step 3:** Which decision is fuzzy?

Every broken stage traces back to a missing or fuzzy decision. Category not locked → Land fails. Alternative not named → Compare stalls. Activation moment not defined → Activate fails.

### Common Patterns

| Symptom | Likely broken stage | Likely missing decision |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| "Wrong people book calls" | Land | Customer, ICP boundary |
| "Can't explain it to their boss" | Make Sense | Outcome, Difference |
| "Everyone says maybe" | Self-Select | Disqualifiers |
| "No urgency, deals drag" | Compare | Alternative (named) |
| "Sounds good but..." | Validate | Proof type, Decision risks |
| "Come back next quarter" | Commit | First step offer, Risk reversal |
| "Signed but not using" | Activate | Activation moment, First value path |
| "Using but easy to cancel" | Embed | Habit loop |
| "Flat revenue per account" | Expand | Expansion trigger |
| "No referrals" | Advocate | Story worth telling |

---

## The Zone Mapping

The Revenue Loop stages map to diagnostic zones:

### Getting to Yes Zones

| Zone | Name | Stages covered |
|------|------|----------------|
| Zone 1 | Make it Buyable | Land, Make Sense |
| Zone 3 | Make it Travel | Self-Select, Compare, Validate |
| Zone 4 | Create Pipeline | Feeds into Land |
| Zone 5 | Close First Wins | Validate, Commit |

### Proving it Right Zones

| Zone | Name | Stages covered |
|------|------|----------------|
| Zone 6 | Make it Stick | Activate, Embed |
| Zone 7 | Capture More Value | Expand |

### Foundation Zones

| Zone | Name | Role |
|------|------|------|
| Zone 2 | Pass the Scale Gate | Economic layer underneath all stages |
| Zone 8 | Make it Investable | Parallel track (investor audience) |
| Zone 9 | Enter New Market | Replay loop for new segment |

---

## What This Changes

When you see revenue as a loop instead of a funnel:

**Churn becomes a buying problem.** If customers leave at Embed, trace back to what was promised at Validate. The loop connects. Overpromise at Validate, underdeliver at Embed.

**Expansion becomes a sales motion.** It's not automatic growth. It's a new buying cycle starting at Compare. New scope, new approval, new objections.

**Proof becomes a product output.** Embed results are Validate inputs for the next buyer. The loop manufactures its own proof.

**Advocacy becomes measurable.** How many new Lands came from Advocates? The loop has attribution.

**PMF becomes testable.** The test isn't "are deals closing?" The test is "are paid customers embedding?" Full value exchange, both directions.

When the loop is locked, you're not pushing growth.  
Growth is pulling you.
